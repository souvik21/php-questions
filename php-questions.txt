Question 1:
-----------

$str1 = 'university';
$str2 = 'uni';
if (strpos($str1,$str2)) {
    echo """ . $str1 . "" contains "" . $str2 . """;
} else {
    echo """ . $str1 . "" does not contain "" . $str2 . """;
}

The above code will produce the following output:
"university" does not contain "uni"

The question: Why and how can this code be fixed so that it works correctly?

Answer:

The function strpos() returns the starting position index of $str2 in $str1 (if found), otherwise it returns false. So in the above code, strpos() returns 0 (which is then coerced to false when referenced in the if statement). That’s why the code doesn’t work properly.

The correct solution would be to use a check condition and explicitly compare the value returned by strpos() to false as follows:

$str1 = 'university';
$str2 = 'uni';
if (strpos($str1,$str2) !== false) {
    echo "\"" . $str1 . "\" contains \"" . $str2 . "\"";
} else {
    echo "\"" . $str1 . "\" does not contain \"" . $str2 . "\"";
}

Also, one thing to note is that the !== operator should be used and not just the != operator. If we use !=, we’ll be back to the problem that 0 is coerced to false when referenced in a boolean expression, so 0 != false will evaluate to false.

Question 2:
-----------

What are the differences between echo and print in PHP?

Answer:

echo and print are largely the same in PHP. Both are used to output data to the screen.

The only differences are as follows:

    echo does not return a value whereas print does return a value of 1 (this enables print to be used in expressions).
    echo can accept multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can only take a single argument.
